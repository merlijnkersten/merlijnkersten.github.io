My personal website with photos.

# Soloespresso
A photo-a-day project that started in April 2018 and continues to date. Files are uploaded every 1-2 weeks. The goal of the page is to provide a space where the photos can be easily viewed.

## Uploading steps
1. Edit and pick photos,

2. Resize to 550px wide (800px prior to 22 March 2020), rename to `soloespressoYYYY-MM-DD<asdf>.jpg`,

3. Run `/photo-a-day/RenamingPhotos.py` to rename photos to 'soloespressoYYYY-MM-DD.jpg',

4. Run `/photo-a-day/GenerateImageTags.py` to generate HTML tags for the new photos, and to move them to the `/assets/` folder. 

5. Update `soloespresso.html` file with tags (from step 4.) and add captions.

6. Add, commit and push changes to Github.
