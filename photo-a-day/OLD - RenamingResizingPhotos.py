# AUTOMATED RE-NAMING AND RESIZING OF PHOTOS     #  
# Sunday, 2 June 2019                            #
# Written using Python 3.7.2 on Windows 10 Pro   #
#                                                #
# Goal: resize and rename all files in a given   #
# folder (assumed to be images) and save them in #
# a different folder.                            #

import os
from datetime import datetime
import random
from PIL import Image

#Set folder containing images as rootdirectory.
root_directory = r"C:\\Users\\Merlijn Kersten\\Pictures\\Photos\soloespresso"
os.chdir(root_directory) #Sets directory

#Steps: 
# 1) find all files in the folder. 
# 2) find their path, and define a new path. 
# 3) find if this new path already exists: if so rename (with random integer to avoid double/triple/... renaming). Generic new name: soloespressoYYYY-MM-DD.jpg ()
# 4) thumbnail image to a width of 800px (height should remain unchanged, therefore max height set to 1,000,000) (images that are smaller will not be changed).
# 5) save image to a sub new folder (which needs to already exist).
